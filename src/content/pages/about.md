## Abandoned Photography & Urban Exploration

<blockquote><br />Take only memories, leave nothing but footprints<br /><br /></blockquote>


Take a walk on the wild side and follow along as Todd Lambert goes in search of the creepiest, freakiest, spookiest abandoned and desolate locations.


As a location scout and avid urban explorer, Todd learned to photograph what he sees and to bring the unique subject matter he finds to light.
